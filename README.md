# Stadia Controller Flasher

This repository retains an original backup of the Stadia Controller flasher utility sitting at https://stadia.google.com/controller/, the repository aims to have a web-based flasher to be able to revert the Stadia controller to its original Gotham firmware (Wi-Fi enabled).

To run the utility write open up your terminal and install all node modules by typing in `npm install`.

Serve the utility by running `npm run serve` then open the site on https://localhost:5000

Largely work in progress and flashing is untested.
